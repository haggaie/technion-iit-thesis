% Use this file to create "glossary entries" for abbreviations and acronyms.
% The entries defined here don't necessarily have to be used in the thesis.

% For this file to compile (and the example text in the main/prelims.tex file),

% Optionally alter the style for typesetting abbreviations when using the \gls
% command. Note you can also use multiple styles by categorizing abbreviations;
